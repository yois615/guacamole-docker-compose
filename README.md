# Guacamole with docker-compose
This project is a fork of `https://github.com/boschkundendienst/guacamole-docker-compose`.
The goal of this fork is to require TOTP authentication using the native Guacamole TOTP extension, to enforce secure Postgres passwords, and to secure nginx with LetsEncrypt and auto renewal by using certbot.

## Prerequisites
You need a working **docker** installation and **docker-compose** running on your machine.

## Quick start
Clone the GIT repository and start guacamole:

~~~bash
git clone "https://github.com/yois615/guacamole-docker-compose.git"
cd guacamole-docker-compose
./install.sh
~~~

Your guacamole server should now be available at `https://DNS of your server/`. The default username is `guacadmin` with password `guacadmin`.

## About Guacamole
Apache Guacamole (incubating) is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. It is called clientless because no plugins or client software are required. Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

It supports RDP, SSH, Telnet and VNC and is the fastest HTML5 gateway I know. Checkout the projects [homepage](https://guacamole.incubator.apache.org/) for more information.

## Details
To understand some details let's take a closer look at parts of the `docker-compose.yml` file:

### Networking
The following part of docker-compose.yml will create a network with name `guacnetwork_compose` in mode `bridged`.
~~~python
...
# networks
# create a network 'guacnetwork_compose' in mode 'bridged'
networks:
  guacnetwork_compose:
    driver: bridge
...
~~~

## install.sh
`install.sh` is a small script that creates `./init/initdb.sql` by downloading the docker image `guacamole/guacamole` and start it like this:

~~~bash
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgres > ./init/initdb.sql
~~~

It creates the necessary database initialization file for postgres.

`install.sh` also creates the certbot configuration

## reset.sh
To reset the database to the beginning, just run `./reset.sh`.  This will not reset certbot data or reset the PostgresDB passwords.

## WOL

Wake on LAN (WOL) does not work and I will not fix that because it is beyound the scope of this repo. But [zukkie777](https://github.com/zukkie777) who also filed [this issue](https://github.com/boschkundendienst/guacamole-docker-compose/issues/12) fixed it. You can read about it on the [Guacamole mailing list](http://apache-guacamole-general-user-mailing-list.2363388.n4.nabble.com/How-to-docker-composer-for-WOL-td9164.html)
